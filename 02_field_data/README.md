# Incorporating field data
Implement the simplest class of methods (fast simulator with noisy field data) from Higdon et al. Applies method to a simple one-dimensional example: dampled simple harmonic motion (underdamped case).

Module `MCMC.py` implements slightly generalized Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm which should be applicable to future examples.
